The general way to deploy a website from nothing. (Rstudio)
Create local scaffolding qmd files
(configure git with the github account, configure the protocoal stuff so the local could be authorized to interact with the remote server)
Init git
(set branch name)
add them to github
adjust the qmd files to customize your file, render commit and push
